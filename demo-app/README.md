## Assignment - 5

### Objective
Develop a React application for an online shoe store with the capability to manage state using Redux. Implement a payment feature that allows users to transition seamlessly from the shopping cart to a payment page. Users should be able to view their cart contents, return to shopping, and enter credit card details for payment processing.

### Problem Description:
Let's make the app using React-Redux, and Redux Toolkit. The application should consist of the following key components:

#### Redux Integration:
Integrate Redux into the React application to manage the state related to the shopping cart.

#### Payment Option: 
Implement a "Proceed to Payment" button within the shopping cart. Clicking this button should redirect users to the payment page.

#### Credit Card Payment:
Include a form on the payment page for users to enter credit card details. 

#### Payment Page: 
Create a payment page where users can view their shopping cart contents. Provide an option for users to return to their shopping cart if they wish to modify it before proceeding with payment.

#### Search Bar: 
Include search bar functionality that is missing from the video. Therefore, implement this feature based on your understanding. 

#### Redux Actions and Reducers:
Define Redux actions and reducers to handle state updates for adding items to the cart and removing items from the cart.

## Assignment - 4

### Objective

Creating a React application using the React Router in which we make a four-page Home, About, User Info, and Not Found Page. 

### Problem Description:

Your task is to develop a React application for a shoe store. It allows customers to view available shoes and add them to their shopping cart using the useState hook provided by React. The application should consist of the following key components:

#### Home and About Page:

Create both pages with your mind, but the UI is attractive. You can choose any website's home and about page, but not copy code, and not create with AI.

#### User Info Page:
Display details of any person, such as their image, name, age, date of birth, and more.

#### Not Found Page:
Show not found page if user accesses the page rather than home, about, and user info

#### Header:
Create a header part with logo and Navlink

### The website should be Responsive according to all screen sizes
